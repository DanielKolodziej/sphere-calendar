## To whom it may concern,
The problem to solve was to create a script that would allow the user to be prompted with a menu to then select their
input of start and end times to be added to the calendar when the user would use touching **(touch-screen)** as their method
of clicking.

All the original functionality is in tacked and continues to function with the added solution of my own that is found in 
the js file, *"touch.js"*.  The html file, *"index.js"*, was also edited in order to add the menu for which the user would
be prompted with.  Lastly css styling was added at the end of the styles file in order to not display the menu and give it
user-friendly styling when it does appear as the user starts a touch event.

My solution is hosted through gh-pages and can be found here [Sphere Front End solution](https://danielkolodziej.github.io/sphere-calendar/).
